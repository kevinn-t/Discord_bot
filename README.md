# Discord_bot-

## Directions for adding the bot to Discord:

### 1) Sign in or make an account for Discord in web browser.
### 2) Once signed in, create your own server and call it whatever you want.
### 3) After you have signed in and made your own Discord server, click on this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=878467917786796122&permissions=0&scope=bot
### 4) Just confirm everything that they ask of you.
### 5) In your server that you have created, type ';help' (without the quotations) to get started.
### ;list is the command that lists out the games we have available!

##The bot now runs on it's own!
